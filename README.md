This repository contains some problems I solved in Prolog, by using one or more predicates.

Indications to run the files: 
- every file has the requirement and one or more predicates defined. In order to run each file, you should open it in Prolog( I recommend VS Code with Prolog extension attached)
- then, open a new terminal and type : swipl
- now you can test each predicate. The main predicate has the comment "THIS IS THE MAIN PREDICATE/FUNCTION".
- type in the terminal the "consult(...)." part after the "%" (% is put in Prolog before a comment). Don't forget to put "." at the end. Ignore the warnings.
- then you call in the terminal the MAIN PREDICATE: example mainAdd_divisors([7,2,8,1],R). , or test()., or whatever predicate you want. Most of the times in the comments at the end of the file you have some examples of
predicates that you can call. After you call them you can try calling with other input values.
